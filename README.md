# LoveAlgorithms

Welcome to **LoveAlgorithms** ‚Äì a playful Java project that uses coding metaphors to debug emotional code and foster growth into your routine

## Features
- **Rescue from broken**: Identify parts of your emotional code needing refactoring
- **Foster growth**: Add new features like affirmations or self-care routines
- **Maths & Metrics**: Calculate your emotional "version" for progress tracking
- **LDR Magic**: Sync progress with your partner through "code reviews"

## How it works
1. **Greets you with an affirmation** to set a positive tone
2. Asks for a **new feature** to add to your emotional API
3. Prompts you to describe why you feel **"broken"** (using playful error logging)
4. Generates a **personalised action plan** with metrics and next steps

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 11+
- Maven (optional)

### Running the programme
